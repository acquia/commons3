; This Drush make script assembles a development version of the Drupal Commons distribution.
; To package Commons using this script, install Drush make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make).
; Packaging with the --working-copy flag is recommended for developers since
; it reduces the effort necessary to roll a patch against Commons components
; that live at http://drupal.org/project/commons .

; Due to legacy naming, we pull the drupal commons make file from another project 'drupal_commons'
